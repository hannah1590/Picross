# Proposal #1 - Dynamic Menu/Game UI
### Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to create a smoothly functioning menu UI that combines style with clarity. As an aspiring UI programmer, delving deeper into dynamically moving UI and all the basic UI aspects that come with it is an interest of mine that I want to prove that I can do well.

## 

### Tools and Technologies
I will be using Unity for this as I am very familiar with its UI functionality and how to integrate it with C#. I believe that using an already made game engine will make it easier to get the basics of the menu on screen instead of using a graphics library, while Unity's integration with Visual Studio allows me to actually program the features of the project, unlike Unreal's visual scripting.

##

### Scope
I plan to implement a basic menu: items, equipment, stats, skills, collection, and settings. Both items and equiment will be gained playing the game, which will just be a very simple move around and kill squares to prove the menu, which can then be used/equipped, with equipment changing something visually on the player. Additionally, the items and equipment can be sorted in different ways depending on their attributes. The stats will be simpler, but will update as the player kills more squares. For skills, I want to implement a skill tree that the player can pick and choose what they want to unlock based on a limited number of skill points they get from defeating squares. The collection is for completionists, such as myself, which lists out all available items/equipment and whether or not the player has collected it at least once. It will include a percent completed that increases the more the player collects items. Lastly, the settings menu will include basic settings options: sound level, brightness, difficulty, and keybinds. Each option will update the player's current state of the game as well.

### Deliverables
This will be delivered as a playable demo, however a video showcasing the menu will be provided if needed for easier demonstration.

# Proposal #2 - Picross Image Uploader

### Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to allow the user to upload any kind of image and then let them play the game picross with that image as a base. As someone who loves systems and gameplay programming, I believe something like this will provide an interesting challenge to showcase my skills.

##

### Tools and Technologies
I plan to use C++ in conjunction with Raylib as a graphics library and OpenCV for its image processing.

##

### Scope
The player can start a game by uploading an image, which will turn itself into a picross puzzle. They can choose whether to play basic picross or the colored version, which changes the puzzle to accomodate for the colors of the image or just base it on dark/light colors. The game itself will be basic picross, with the numbers for each cell lining the side and the player having the objection to color in or cross out a cell to help them figure out the puzzle. Once they finish, they can upload another picture if they want to.

### Deliverables
This will be delivered as a playable demo, however a video showcasing the menu will be provided if needed for easier demonstration.

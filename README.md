# Picross Image Uploader

### Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to allow the user to upload any kind of image and then let them play the game picross with that image as a base. As someone who loves systems and gameplay programming, I believe something like this will provide an interesting challenge to showcase my skills.

### Tools and Technologies
I plan to use C++ in conjunction with Raylib as a graphics library and OpenCV for its image processing.

### Scope
The player can start a game by uploading an image, which will turn itself into a picross puzzle. They can choose whether to play basic picross or the colored version, which changes the puzzle to accomodate for the colors of the image or just base it on dark/light colors. The game itself will be basic picross, with the numbers for each cell lining the side and the player having the objection to color in or cross out a cell to help them figure out the puzzle. Once they finish, they can upload another picture if they want to.

### Deliverables
This will be delivered as a playable demo, however a video showcasing the menu will be provided if needed for easier demonstration.
